Learnings
=========

A project where I place all of my different trials and learnings - somewhere that I can return to and pickup because I know that it works.

## Iterator ##

An idea I had was to try and see what it would look like if I used anonymous functions as a means of iterating over collections
rather than using a for loop.  The experiment was successful in that it can be done, the code is simple to understand although
it is a little verbose.


## jade2j ##

Add HAML style templating to Java - not an exact match but looks very promising.

* Incorporated Apache commons stopwatch - simple but cool.


## JVM Cucumber - Maven 3 - Java - Groovy  ##

Pull all of these features together into a single POM so that:

* Used from maven
* Able to cucumber Java code
* Able to cucumber Groovy code
